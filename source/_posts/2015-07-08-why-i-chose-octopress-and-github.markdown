### What's Octopress
[Octopress](http://octopress.org) is "A blogging framework for hackers". It's based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) Which is ruby statics web generator. Octopress is **hackers** so you should be familiar with shell and git commands or at least have the courage try.

### Why github
Github is offering service for hosting your **static pages** [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) powered by Jekyll under the hod. This help you to deploy your Octopress blog easily. And git offer more flexible ways yo manage your blog content.


### You didn't tell me why Octopress
I chosen Octopress for couple of reasons:

+ [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/): I love to use it when ever it's possible. At Github, Stackoverflow or writing emails.
+ sharing code: With Octopress sharing snippets of code is easier then ever.  Either with markdown or with [gist tag](http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/gist-tag/)

    ``` python
import something
print 'markdown'

    ```
+ Git: deploying of Octopress help me to learn more on git (All I knew before was clone, pull and push). And the process of posting help me understand branches and practice them.

To be continued...
