## What's Octopress
[Octopress](http://octopress.org) is "A blogging framework for hackers". It's based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) Which is ruby statics web generator. Octopress is for **hackers** so you should be familiar with shell and git commands or at least have the courage to try.

## Why github
Github is offering service for hosting your **static pages** for free [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) powered by Jekyll under the hod. This helps you to deploy your Octopress blog easily. And git offers more flexible ways to manage your blog content.


## You didn't tell me why Octopress
I chose Octopress for couple of reasons:

+ [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/): posts in Octopress are written in markdown then transformed to HTML. And since I love to use it whenever it's possible (Github, Stackoverflow or writing emails), I found it convient to me.
+ sharing code: With Octopress sharing snippets of code is easier then ever.  Either with markdown or with [gist tag](http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/gist-tag/)

``` python
import something
print 'markdown'
```
{% gist a1bff4a8c2e8f0534645 %}

+ Git: deploying of Octopress help me to learn more on git (All I knew before was clone, pull and push). And the process of posting helps me understand branches and practice them.

## Theme:

I'm a big fun of [solarized](https://github.com/octopress/solarized) theme I love to use it every place I can. However in octopress there are some problems with gists and markdown. So I decided to take a look on others [themes](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes). Until I found [HPSTR](https://github.com/jez/hpstr-theme/). This blog is now using HPSTR and I don't think that I will change it in the near future.
